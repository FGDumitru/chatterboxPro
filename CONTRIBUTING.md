# Contributing to Chatterbox Pro

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Chatterbox Pro! We welcome all contributions, from bug fixes to new features.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To ensure that Chatterbox Pro can be sustainably maintained and developed under its dual-license model, we require all contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

The CLA grants us (the project maintainers) the copyright to your contribution. This allows us to re-license the code under our commercial license, which is essential for funding the project's development. In return, your contribution will be made available to the community under the AGPLv3 license as part of the open-source version of Chatterbox Pro.

**Before we can merge your pull request, you must sign the CLA.**

*(We recommend using a service like [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) to automate this process. Once set up, it will comment on pull requests and guide contributors through signing.)*

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the project.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Make your changes in a new git branch: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch master`
3.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a clear commit message.
4.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository.

## üìú Licensing

Chatterbox Pro is released under a dual-license model to support its ongoing development while providing a free and open-source version for the community.

### Open Source License (AGPLv3)

For open source projects, academic research, and non-commercial personal use, Chatterbox Pro is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**.

Under the AGPLv3, you are free to:
*   Use and modify the software.
*   Distribute your modified versions.

However, if you use Chatterbox Pro (or any modified version) as part of a service that is accessible over a network, you are required to make the full source code of your service available to its users under the same AGPLv3 license. You can find the full license text in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

### Commercial License

For businesses and commercial use cases where the obligations of the AGPLv3 are not suitable, we offer a commercial license. A commercial license allows you to embed Chatterbox Pro in your proprietary applications and services without the source-sharing requirements of the AGPLv3.
